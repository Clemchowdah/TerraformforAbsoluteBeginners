# Using Git, Github, and VsCode
## What is this?
Git is meant to handle projects of varying sizes and tracking changes in code. Github uses Git to store projects and code so that developers can share and work on projects together. Visual Studio Code, or VsCode, is a code editor where users can integrate different programs and programming languages to complete their coding needs.

_Note: VsCode isn't required to do the work, however, it is widely used because of its many tools and abilities packed in it._

## Objective
You will be able to download Git, create and use a Github account, and download VsCode while pushing content from VsCode into a Github Repository.
